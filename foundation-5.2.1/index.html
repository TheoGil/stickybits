    <div class="large-7 columns:">
      <p>The Cisco Meraki office in Mission Bay, San Francisco, is 40 paces from the water, and just as nice as Google’s. On a clear winter day in late December, I sat in one of its conference rooms with a company spokeswoman on my right and Sanjit Biswas on my left, peering out through floor-to-ceiling glass. On the other side: brightly patterned furniture, murals and paneled wood, a well-stocked cafeteria, a deck with spectacular views of the bay. Twelve months earlier, in a deal meant to bring fresh edge to Cisco, the networking behemoth bought Meraki from Biswas and two co-founders for $1.2 billion. Now they were making good on their promise — starting with the décor.</p>
      <p>Like Cisco, Meraki makes networking equipment — routers, wireless devices and the software to manage them, the sorts of products that even by tech standards have always been a little short on glamour. When Biswas and his co-founders left their graduate programs at M.I.T. in 2006 to work full time on Meraki — the name comes from a Greek word that means creating something with passion — they had few start-up competitors among their peers, who were making Twitter knockoffs. Six years later, their company had become a formidable player in the midsize router market. In a field notorious for opaque technical standards, Meraki emphasized simplicity and ease of use, while also managing to tick a lot of boxes on any Web 2.0 checklist: cloud-based, scalable, mobile-friendly. “They’re buzzwords,” Biswas said. “But they’re also true.” You don’t need a SWAT team of technicians to set up a Meraki router; the system is intuitive and well designed, qualities that are especially appealing to a company like Cisco, which has dominated networking for three decades but has struggled in recent years to maintain its air of leading-edge inevitability.</p>
      <p>The same dynamic is playing out throughout Silicon Valley, as companies like Intel post disappointing earnings reports and others like Snapchat turn down billion-dollar offers. The rapid consumer-ification of tech, led by Facebook and Google, has created a deep rift between old and new, hardware and software, enterprise companies that sell to other businesses and consumer companies that sell directly to the masses. On their face, these cleavages seem to be part of the natural order. As Biswas pointed out, “There has always been a constant churn of new companies coming in, old companies dying out.”</p>
      <p>But the churn feels more problematic now, in part because it deprives the new guard as well as the old — and by extension, it deprives us all. In pursuing the latest and the coolest, young engineers ignore opportunities in less-sexy areas of tech like semiconductors, data storage and networking, the products that form the foundation on which all of Web 2.0 rests. Without a good router to provide reliable Wi-Fi, your Dropbox file-sharing application is not going to sync; without Nvidia’s graphics processing unit, your BuzzFeed GIF is not going to make anyone laugh. The talent — and there’s a ton of it — flowing into Silicon Valley cares little about improving these infrastructural elements. What they care about is coming up with more web apps.</p>
      <img src="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/10/magazine/mag-16Silicon_old1/mag-16Silicon_old1-articleLarge-v2.png">
      <p>As an enterprise start-up, Meraki has been impeded by its distance from the web scene. It simply does not have the same recognition as a consumer company whose products users (and potential recruits) interact with every day. “You say, ‘I work at Pinterest,’ and people know what that is — they use Pinterest,” Biswas said. “You tell them you work at Meraki, and they’re a little more reserved. They’re like, ‘What’s that?’ Once we explained our culture and our approach, we were able to hire great talent, but it’s always a challenge.” Since the acquisition, Biswas, who is 32, has fought to retain the spirit of the vanguard, but his struggle reveals an implicit fear — that young engineers might be willing to work at Meraki but not at Cisco (because it’s too big and fusty), or that clients might be willing to buy from Cisco but not Meraki (because they don’t really trust start-ups).</p>
      <p>What’s cool? Who can be trusted? Why does one start-up go public, while another, which seems to do the same thing, fizzles? What logic, if any, pertains to where the money flows? These are the anxious questions that pervade Silicon Valley now, I think, more than ever — the vague sense of a frenzied bubble of app-making and an even vaguer dread that what we are making might not be that meaningful.</p>
      <p><strong>Smart Kids and Their Sexting Apps</strong></p>
      <p>The backlash in recent months against the self-involvement and frivolity of the new guard has actually been a long time coming. Instagram photos of opulent tech holiday parties have been lambasted, Google buses blockaded. It’s something I wrestle with myself. Back in November, I signed on for an internship this summer at Uber, the taxi-app-turned-transportation-logistics company that is one of the valley’s hottest start-ups. Last August, it raised $258 million and was valued at about $3.5 billion; this winter, it partnered with Xbox and Bud Light for Super Bowl promotions. Uber’s clashes with various municipal authorities have been reported on with the kind of glee usually reserved for philandering politicians.</p>
      <p>When I first started using the app, I was a fan but not a disciple. It provided an efficient solution to a niche problem — rich techies needed a ride home after a night on the town and couldn’t get one — and therefore was of limited scope. I was confused why a taxi app, or any iPhone app, for that matter, needed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. But it had a great data blog that I enjoyed, so I applied for an internship. When I got the job, friends who worked in tech were excited. Friends who worked in venture capital were excited. I started reading articles on TechCrunch about how Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, envisions a company that will become the universal way to transport purchases and people, and about how its motto had been changed from “Everyone’s Private Driver” to the more expansive “Where Lifestyle Meets Logistics.” The more I read, the more I heard, the more I started to see that vision myself.</p>
      <p>What was impressive to me was not the ambitious leap of logic from “rideshare” to “Amazon for logistics,” but how quickly that final notion became a foregone conclusion in my mind. It’s a testament to the effectiveness of Uber’s media campaign that now, when I think about the company, I think, of course Uber will one day replace school buses, or deliver meals, or join with self-driving Google cars to eliminate private vehicles and save the environment! Conviction animates every start-up. Uber could be bigger than Facebook! Or, of course, it could go the way of the location check-in app Foursquare, which had a meteoric rise but whose valuations have since languished in the mere hundreds of millions of dollars. Not every start-up is an unequivocal success. Trying to pick the winners is part of what makes the current ecosystem so fickle, but also so fun.</p>
      <p>The other night I was studying late for a midterm exam — I am a grad student in computer science at Columbia University — with several friends who will be working at Dropbox and Facebook this summer. Around 9 o’clock, we ordered Chinese food on Seamless. I paid one of the guys back with the digital wallet Venmo. This summer in San Francisco, I’m living with three roommates, also students doing tech internships in the valley, two at Google and one at the news aggregator Flipboard. For better or worse, these are the kinds of companies that seem to be winning the recruiting race, and if the traditional lament at Ivy League schools has been that the best talent goes to Wall Street, a newer one is taking shape: Why do these smart, quantitatively trained engineers, who could help cure cancer or fix healthcare.gov, want to work for a sexting app?</p>
      <p>Part of the answer, I think, lies in the excitement I’ve been hinting at. Another part is prestige. Smart kids want to work for a sexting app because other smart kids want to work for the same sexting app. “Highly concentrated pools of top talent are one of the rarest things you can find,” Biswas told me, “and I think people are really attracted to those environments.” But that presumes that the talent at older companies is somehow subpar, less technically proficient, than it is at their younger counterparts. This seems unlikely if you look at Cisco’s list of patents. Yet clearly there exists some sort of discrepancy between the talent the new guard looks for and the old guard provides. There are thousands of engineers working at big corporations in Silicon Valley, many with years of experience and proven track records of creating code. Many of them have also been through several cycles of layoffs, as older companies divest assets and shave costs. So why are start-ups constantly bemoaning a shortage of talent?</p>
      <p>The easiest explanations are mismatched skill sets or cultural friction. Older engineers are not smart in the way that start-ups want them to be — or, if they are, they have reservations about the start-up lifestyle. Both these reasons are symptomatic of how far apart the two sides have drifted. If there are whole swaths of engineering talent whose skills or styles cannot be integrated into a company, then maybe that operation has been limiting itself. As David Dalrymple, a technologist in the valley, told me, “The most innovative and effective companies are old-guard companies that have managed to reach out to the new guard, like Apple, or vice versa, like Google.”</p>
      <p>Dalrymple’s description makes sense, but its implied recommendation — that new and old need to embrace each other — is difficult to put into practice. Several of Cisco’s previous attempts to reach out to the new guard, like the Flip video camera and the Cius tablet, were busts. The phrase that’s constantly repeated in the valley is “innovate or die.” Innovation, everyone seems to agree, is the answer. The problem is that so many “innovations” — Intel’s “creative collaboration” with the rapper will.i.am, for instance — are just some stuffy vice president’s approximation of cool. That is to say, they’re hardly innovative at all.</p>
      <p><strong>Dad, Engineering Lifer</strong></p>
      <p>My dad was 31 when he came to the Bay Area in 1995. He had a wife and two kids and went to work for a company called DSC Communications, which made telecommunications equipment. Much of the excitement in the valley at that time was over advances in Ethernet and network speeds that would eventually lead to widespread access to the Internet and to the merging of telephony and data. (Actually, we lived in a different valley then: “Telecom Valley,” which was a nickname for Petaluma, north of San Francisco.)</p>
      <p>Three years later, when my dad decided to leave DSC, he had two job offers, both at networking start-ups founded by DSC alumni — one called Fibex, the other called Cerent. They made similar products and were of comparable size and prospects; he chose Fibex because he disliked one of the engineers at Cerent he would have had to work closely with. I was too young at the time to remember what it was like after he started his new job, but my mother tells me it was as hectic and late-night and junk-food-fueled as any of the start-up scenes of my generation. He was lucky. A little over a year after my dad joined Fibex, Cisco bought it for approximately $320 million. Then, a few months later, Cisco bought Cerent too — for $7.2 billion. That 20-fold difference between the money he made and the money he could have made has been fodder for family jokes ever since. Yet despite the obvious incentives, he never did go to another start-up.</p>
      <p>I know that my dad’s choices were constrained by circumstances — his family, his immigration status — but his self-image was always more engineer than entrepreneur. I think he has been happy being a “lifer” at Cisco in a way that few of my friends would be at Google.</p>
      <p>There are certainly young engineers today comfortably ensconced at established companies, just as there are 50-year-olds at their fourth start-up. But as a group, my peers feel more restless, more constantly in search of the next big thing — in part because start-ups select for and reward these impulses, which also spur the successive exoduses from Yahoo to Google, from Google to Facebook, from Facebook to younger, hipper companies. These are places where the C.E.O. often sits alongside the engineers, where recruiters talk about a “flat” hierarchy as a perk on par with paternity leave, where regular engineers get equity. Some of these changes have occurred out of necessity. “In the ‘80s, it was not uncommon to pay people salaries and give them few if any stock options,” Biswas said. “Now, you can’t have a company like Facebook and attract that kind of talent without offering equity.” Other changes simply come from the spirit of the times — when a company’s product is premised on a mobile, open, connected world, it doesn’t do for its C.E.O. to be sitting in a corner office.</p>
      <p><strong>There’s an App — and an A.P.I. — for That</strong></p> 
      <p>All varieties of ambition head to Silicon Valley now — it can no longer be designated the sole domain of nerds like Steve Wozniak or even successor nerds like Mark Zuckerberg. The face of web tech today could easily be a designer, like Brian Chesky at Airbnb, or a magazine editor, like Jeff Koyen at Assignmint. Such entrepreneurs come from backgrounds outside computer science and are likely to think of their companies in terms more grandiose than their technical components. Chesky, for instance, has described Airbnb as a “community marketplace that connects people through unique spaces around the world” — a valid business model, but not one that necessarily depends on any particular technology.</p>
      <p>By contrast, Intel, founded by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, both physicists, began by building memory chips that were twice as fast as old ones. Sun Microsystems introduced a new kind of modular computer system, built by one of its founders, Andy Bechtolsheim. Their “big ideas” were expressed in physical products and grew out of their own technical expertise. In that light, Meraki, which came from Biswas’s work at M.I.T., can be seen as having its origins in the old guard. And it followed what was for decades the highway that connected academia to industry: Grad students researched technology, powerful advisers brokered deals, students dropped out to parlay their technologies into proprietary solutions, everyone reaped the profits. That implicit guarantee of academia’s place in entrepreneurship has since disappeared. Graduate students still drop out, but to start bike-sharing apps and become data scientists. That is, if they even make it to graduate school. The success of self-educated savants like Sean Parker, who founded Napster and became Facebook’s first president with no college education to speak of, set the template. Enstitute, a two-year apprenticeship, embeds high-school graduates in plum tech positions. Thiel Fellowships, financed by the PayPal co-founder and Facebook investor Peter Thiel, give $100,000 to people under 20 to forgo college and work on projects of their choosing.</p>

      <p>Much of this precocity — or dilettantism, depending on your point of view — has been enabled by web technologies, by easy-to-use programming frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Node.js and by the explosion of application programming interfaces (A.P.I.s) that supply off-the-shelf solutions to entrepreneurs who used to have to write all their own code for features like a login system or an embedded map. Now anyone can do it, thanks to the Facebook login A.P.I. or the Google Maps A.P.I.</p>
      <p>One of the more enterprising examples of these kinds of interfaces is the start-up Stripe, which sells A.P.I.s that enable businesses to process online payments. When Meraki first looked into taking credit cards online, according to Biswas, it was a monthslong project fraught with decisions about security and cryptography. “Now, with Stripe, it takes five minutes,” he said. “When you combine that with the ability to get a server in five minutes, with Rails and Twitter Bootstrap, you see that it has become infinitely easier for four people to get a start-up off the ground.”</p>
      <p>The sense that it is no longer necessary to have particularly deep domain knowledge before founding your own start-up is real; that and the willingness of venture capitalists to finance Mark Zuckerberg look-alikes are changing the landscape of tech products. There are more platforms, more websites, more pat solutions to serious problems — here’s an app that can fix drug addiction! promote fiscal responsibility! advance childhood literacy! Companies like Meraki that build enterprise-grade hardware and leverage years of research tend to be anomalies among the new guard. Even as the pool of founders has grown and diversified, the products themselves seem more homogeneous, more pedestrian.</p>
